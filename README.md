# Code Writer Demo Repository

This repository serves as a demonstration sandbox for **code writer and code understanding** capabilities using Glean's AI-powered code search and analysis.

## About

This repo contains example code and structured demo scenarios designed to showcase how non-technical stakeholders can query codebases in natural language to extract business context, regulatory information, and technical insights without reading code.

## Demos Folder

The [`demos/`](./demos) folder contains comprehensive demo scenarios, including:

- **Quick-Impact Code Understanding Demo Ideas for Non-Technical Medtronic Roles** - 12 structured demo scenarios covering use cases like:
  - Legacy code forensics
  - Compliance impact analysis
  - Bug impact assessment
  - Requirements traceability
  - Security vulnerability audits
  - And more...

Each demo includes scenario context, user roles, example questions, live flow walkthroughs, business value propositions, and implementation notes.

## Demo Data

Additional **synthetic data** for demonstration purposes is available in this shared folder:

**[Synthetic Demo Data on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EdarblYE0Akc0RHVqMySu4955al_fP6_)**

This data is synthetic and safe for demonstration use.

## Usage

Here's a simple Hello World program in Python:
