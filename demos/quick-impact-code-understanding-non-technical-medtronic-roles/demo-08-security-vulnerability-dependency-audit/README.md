# Demo Idea 8 – "What Security Vulnerabilities Are We Exposed To?" – Third-Party Dependency Audit

**Title:** "What Security Vulnerabilities Are We Exposed To?" - Third-Party Dependency Audit

**Scenario:** A security analyst receives an alert: "CVE-2024-XXXX affects OpenSSL versions <1.1.1w." They need to know: "Are we using the vulnerable version anywhere in our medical device software?"

**User Role:** Security Analyst (may be non-technical)

**Demo Question:**  "Which parts of our codebase use OpenSSL? What version are we using? Show me all dependencies, configuration files, and build scripts that reference OpenSSL."

**Live Flow:**
- Search for OpenSSL references across codebase
- Show dependency files: requirements.txt, package.json, pom.xml
- Highlight version: openssl==1.1.1u (vulnerable!)
- Find usage points in code: encryption modules, API authentication
- Surface affected components: device firmware update module, secure telemetry

**Business Value:** Security teams can quickly assess vulnerability exposure and scope remediation efforts, reducing time-to-patch for critical security issues and preventing potential medical device cybersecurity incidents.

**Non-Technical Value Proposition:** "When security alerts arrive, get immediate exposure assessment - no waiting for developers to audit dependencies manually."

**Risk Notes:** Extremely timely for cybersecurity (FDA SBOM requirements). Shows clear risk identification. Can demo with dependency files without code execution.
