## 🎯 Demo Flow Recommendations

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)

"Code contains the truth about how your medical devices actually work - every design decision, every regulatory constraint, every customer workaround. But code is locked away from the 80% of people who need that knowledge but can't read Python or C++. Today I'll show you how non-technical roles can ask questions directly to your codebase - in plain English."

### Sequencing (Pick 3-4 for a 10-minute demo)

#### For Regulatory/Compliance Audience:
1. Start with Data Privacy Impact Analysis (GDPR/HIPAA relevance)
2. Add Requirements Traceability (FDA submission value)
3. Include Regulatory Change Impact (scoping updates)
4. Close with Legacy Code Forensics (safety rationale)

#### For Product/UX Audience:
1. Start with Legacy Code Forensics - Design Rationale (UX decisions)
2. Add Feature Usage Analysis (deprecation decisions)
3. Include Release Notes Preparation (customer communication)
4. Close with Business Logic Verification (refactoring safety)

#### For Support/Operations Audience:
1. Start with Bug Impact Assessment (incident response)
2. Add Expert Identification (knowledge risks)
3. Include Integration Data Flows (customer questions)
4. Close with Security Vulnerability Audit (risk management)

#### For Cross-Functional Leadership:
1. Start with Compliance Impact Analysis (regulatory)
2. Add Bug Impact Assessment (operations)
3. Include Legacy Code Forensics (product)
4. Close with Expert Identification (org risk)

### Transition Language

- "Now let's look at a different role - imagine you're a..."
- "Here's another question that previously required an engineer..."
- "Moving from product to compliance..."
- "This scenario happens weekly in medical device companies..."

### Medtronic-Specific Context

- "With 15-20 year device lifecycles, institutional knowledge walks out the door..."
- "FDA submissions require traceability you can't get from memory..."
- "When customer support gets technical questions, they can't wait 48 hours..."
- "Your code represents $50M+ in R&D decisions - make that knowledge accessible..."

## Value Propositions by Role

### Product Managers
- "Make data-driven prioritization decisions with code evidence"
- "Understand engineering constraints before proposing changes"
- "Verify business requirements are actually implemented"

### Compliance/Regulatory
- "Audit data handling without technical staff"
- "Prove requirements traceability for submissions"
- "Assess regulatory change impact in minutes"

### Support Teams
- "Answer customer technical questions with authority"
- "Scope incident impact without escalation"
- "Find experts who can help with legacy issues"

### Technical Writers
- "Generate accurate documentation from source of truth"
- "Track changes between releases automatically"
- "Verify feature documentation matches implementation"

### Security Teams
- "Assess vulnerability exposure immediately"
- "Audit third-party dependencies continuously"
- "Identify security-critical code paths"

### Sales Engineers
- "Answer integration questions in real-time"
- "Verify feature claims with code evidence"
- "Understand product limitations before promising features"

## Metrics to Highlight

- **Knowledge Access:** "80% of people who need code knowledge can't read code"
- **Time Savings:** "Questions answered in seconds, not days of engineer time"
- **Risk Reduction:** "Prevent re-introduction of safety issues fixed years ago"
- **Compliance:** "FDA/GDPR audits require this level of traceability"
- **Institutional Knowledge:** "Code outlives people - preserve the 'why' not just the 'what'"

---

## Safety Tips

- Use real code search capability - very reliable
- Prepare specific file paths or module names in advance
- Have example questions written out for smooth delivery
- Know where good code comments exist for impactful reveals
- Can demo against public repos if internal code is sensitive

---

## Powerful Closing Messages

- "Your code is a knowledge asset, not just a technical artifact"
- "Democratize technical truth - let business stakeholders verify, not just trust"
- "Institutional knowledge shouldn't retire when engineers do"
- "In regulated industries, 'I think' isn't good enough - query the source of truth"

---

## ROI Framing

**Before:** "Non-technical person → Email engineer → Wait → Get summary (maybe accurate)"

**After:** "Non-technical person → Ask code directly → Immediate answer (authoritative)"

---

## Demo Success Criteria

- Audience says: "I didn't know I could do that without being a developer"
- Audience identifies their own use cases during demo
- Regulatory/compliance people lean forward (they feel pain of manual code audits)
- Product managers nod at "understand why before changing"
