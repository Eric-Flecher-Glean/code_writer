# Demo Idea 4 – "What Changed Between These Two Releases?" – Release Notes Preparation

**Title:** "What Changed Between These Two Releases?" - Release Notes Preparation

**Scenario:** A technical writer needs to prepare release notes for the quarterly firmware update but engineering committed 247 changes. Writer needs to identify customer-facing changes vs. internal refactoring.

**User Role:** Technical Writer (non-technical)

**Demo Question:**  "Between firmware version 4.1.0 and 4.2.0, what user-facing features changed? Show me new alarm types, UI changes, modified clinical workflows, or new device settings. Exclude internal code refactoring and performance optimizations."

**Live Flow:**
- Ask the question to code search across version tags
- Show results filtered to customer-impacting changes
- Highlight: New alarm threshold settings, modified alert sound patterns, updated screen layouts
- Surface commit messages mentioning "user-facing" or "clinical workflow"
- Exclude backend optimizations automatically

**Business Value:** Technical writers create accurate, complete release notes in hours instead of days, without chasing down busy engineers for explanations. Customer documentation stays current and comprehensive.

**Non-Technical Value Proposition:** "Transform technical commits into customer-readable release notes without understanding the code - just ask what changed from the user's perspective."

**Risk Notes:** Shows practical documentation workflow. Very visual (before/after). Clear time savings. Applicable to any software release cycle.
